# Steam Dataset 2025 Case Study

Retrospective analysis of the Steam Dataset 2025 as a proto-ARD.

## Overview

The Steam Dataset 2025 is a gaming catalog enhanced with BGE-M3 embeddings and graph-ready relationships. Developed before the ARD concept was formalized, it serves as retrospective validation that the pattern has practical value across domains.

**Implementation Repository:** [steam-dataset-2025](https://github.com/radioastronomyio/steam-dataset-2025)

---

## Status

**Retrospective documentation pending.** The dataset exists and has demonstrated community engagement; documentation of how it exemplifies ARD principles is future work.

---

## Why This Matters

The Steam dataset demonstrates ARD value in a non-scientific domain:

| ARD Principle | Steam Implementation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Pre-computed embeddings | BGE-M3 vectors over game descriptions |
| Graph-ready relationships | Publisher/developer networks materialized |
| Community compute absorption | Similarity search without user-side inference |

Community engagement metrics (Kaggle/Zenodo downloads) validate demand for pre-computed ML modalities.
