=============================================================================
TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION FOR ANALYSIS-READY-DATASETS
=============================================================================

Adapted from standard general-kb-template for methodology repository.

KEY CHANGES:
- Removed numbered sections (simpler for documentation)
- Updated tag categories to ARD-relevant values
- Removed Audience section (usually obvious from context)
- Kept Purpose, Scope, References, Document Info as standard wrapper

STRUCTURE:
- Purpose: Always include (why this exists)
- Scope: Include if boundaries need definition
- [Content Sections]: Your actual content, named appropriately
- References: Include if external resources cited
- Document Info: Always include

TAG CATEGORIES FOR ARD:
- type: guide, reference, specification, methodology, research-output
- domain: framework, case-study, research, infrastructure
- tech: embeddings, postgresql, parquet, disperse, bagpipes, etc.
- audience: implementers, researchers, all

KEEP IT LEAN: Wrapper is thin. Content is the point.
