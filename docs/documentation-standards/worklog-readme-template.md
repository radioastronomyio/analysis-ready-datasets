TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION FOR ANALYSIS-READY-DATASETS
=============================================================================

Adapted from standard worklog-readme-template for documentation repository.
Removed recipe-focused structure; adapted for methodology/research work.

- Removed "Phase/Milestone" framing (this repo doesn't use milestones)
- Changed "Recipes Added/Modified" to "Artifacts Produced"
- Simplified for documentation and research outputs
- Removed numbered sections for simpler structure

SECTIONS:
- Summary: Always (quick overview with objective/outcome)
- Contents: Always (directory tree)
- Key Decisions: Include if decisions were made
- Artifacts Produced: Include if artifacts were created
- Issues/Observations: Include if noteworthy items
- Next Steps: Include if work continues
