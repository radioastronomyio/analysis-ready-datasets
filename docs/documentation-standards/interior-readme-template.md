=============================================================================
TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION FOR ANALYSIS-READY-DATASETS
=============================================================================

Simplified from standard interior-readme-template for documentation repository.
Removed recipe-focused structure; adapted for methodology/knowledge base content.

SECTIONS:
- Contents: Always include (tree view of directory)
- Documents: Include if directory contains documentation files
- Subdirectories: Include if meaningful subdirectories exist
- Related: Include if relationships to other content exist

KEEP IT LEAN: Add sections as needed, don't fill for completeness.

SECTION NUMBERING: Removed numbered sections for simpler documentation.
If semantic numbering needed, add back with gap preservation rule.
